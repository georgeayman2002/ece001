    During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan
    coronavirus" with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia"In the past, many diseases have been named after
    geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus. In January 2020,
    the WHO recommended 2019-nov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per
    2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species,
    or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID-19 and
    SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for
    disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019) The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19
    virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications

<P>
    Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness Common symptoms include headache
    loss of smell and taste nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever diarrhea, and
    breathing difficulties People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change
    over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough,
    sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and
    fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea In people without prior ear,
    nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID-

    Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop
    severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients suffer critical
    symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) At least a third of the people who are infected
    with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time These asymptomatic carriers tend not to get
    tested and can spread the disease Other infected people will develop symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or
    have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus

    As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance
    of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days Most symptomatic people experience
    symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days

    Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of
    effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are
    underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease
