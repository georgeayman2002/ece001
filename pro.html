    During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan
    coronavirus" with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia"In the past, many diseases have been named after
    geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus. In January 2020,
    the WHO recommended 2019-nov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per
    2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species,
    or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID-19 and
    SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020 Tedros Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for
    disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019) The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19
    virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications
